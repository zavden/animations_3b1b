# Changes from the original (look for '# CHANGE' in the code):
#   - Replaced Grant's nanoGPT model (nonexistent checkpoint) with a synthetic character model (n-grams over text_data/ + English frequencies); the probabilities shown are plausible, not those of the real model.
#
# Placeholder assets (not Grant's originals):
#   - text_data/quotes.txt and training_data_examples.txt: original text and public-domain quotes (_lib/assets/generated/2026/cross_entropy/text_data/) instead of 3b1b's, which quoted copyrighted works
