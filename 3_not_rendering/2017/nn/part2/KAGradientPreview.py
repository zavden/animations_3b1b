# Scene:      KAGradientPreview
# Source:     videos/_2017/nn/part2.py (lines 1943-1944)
# Category:   3 · Does not render
# Includes code copied from: _2017/nn/part1.py
#
# Run from this folder:
#     manimgl KAGradientPreview.py KAGradientPreview -w -m --fps 15
#
# Changes from the original (look for '# CHANGE' in the code):
#   - Provide package `nn` (network.py with binary-mode pickle fix, mnist_loader.py reading a small synthetic MNIST stand-in) through data_files, since the original mnist.pkl.gz is not in the repo.
#   - Put the scene folder on sys.path so the bundled `nn` package (data_files) can be imported; manimgl does not add the script dir.
#
# Placeholder assets (not Grant's originals):
#   - _lib/assets/generated/2017/nn/nn_pkg/mnist_mini.npz (synthetic MNIST stand-in, built from the 100 real digits of image_map by make_nn_support.py)
#
# Why it does not render:
#   ExternallyAnimatedScene: the scene body is just `pass` (the video segment was animated outside manim), so there is nothing to render.
